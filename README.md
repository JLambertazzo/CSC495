# CSC495
CLR-US

## Local Setup
Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed (C#/.NET/Node.js). In appsettings.json, replace `<password>` with the MongoDB password and then go ahead and run the project.

> **Warning**
> DO NOT commit changes to appsettings.json if you are including the MongoDB password

## Running the project

### Running the backend
Build with `dotnet build` then `dotnet run` in `/clr-api`. This is easier if using an IDE like Rider for development since it handles a lot of the building/running automatically.

### Running the frontend
In the `/clr-us` folder, install dependencies with `npm i` then run with `npm start`.
